description: Discard a terminal Codex agent's worktree and delete its branch

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as `<agent_id>`. Call `magic-codex` MCP tool `discard`.

If the agent is still running, explain the user must `/magic-codex-cancel` first. This action is irreversible; warn before proceeding on any agent whose work has not been reviewed.
